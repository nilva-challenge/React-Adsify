# In name of Allah

## Introduction
We want a simple app to browse different ads. This app consists of two main parts:

1. Dashboard: Dashboard is a simple page with two main modes, the first is a list of banners & the second is a list of videos. Both lists are a grid of items (each item is a photo and title, the size of photo should be 300 * 300). **Note** that this page should be connected to API and retrieve items from API (you can use [picsum](https://picsum.photos/) for random photos, as for titles use the author name of picture). Also note the list is infinite, but only 60 items will be shown at first, with scroll of user new items (60 ones) must be got from API. 
When clicked on each item, the user will be navigated to Video/Banner page.

**Note** that this list should be responsive.

2. Video/Banner page: This page shows a video or a banner based on what mode the dashboard item was. the video or banner will be retrieved from API (like [this](http://www.clipstill.com/wp-content/uploads/000055_swan_thumb.mp4?_=1)). Also a counter must shown below video/banner, which indicates how many times user has clicked on video/banner (this means you should track clicks on video/banner).

### Note
Use redux for state management.

## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- a clean structure of codebase & components
- clean code practices
- ability to layout page correctly
- responsive design
- well designed API calls
- profound understanding of states
- finally, ability to learn

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository
2. Estimate the develop & send it to us
3. Break and specify your tasks in project management tool (append the image of your tasks to readme file of your project)
4. Learn & Develop
5. Push your code to your repository
6. Explain the roadmap of your development in readme of repository (also append the image of your specified tasks on part 3 to file)
6. Send us a pull request, we will review and get back to you
7. Enjoy

**Finally** don't be afraid to ask anything from us.


### my roadmap for developing this project
1. break down the entire project to component
  - navigation bar
  - header
  - main content (list of items)
2. create a very basic and static file structure and component
3. add eventHandlers and some more basic interactitvities
4. working on state and declaring the structrue for that
5. add api calls and final steps on interacivity
